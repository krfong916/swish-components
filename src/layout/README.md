# Layout

Swish Layout is a responsive layout that adapts to screen size and orientation.

## Design

Swish uses CSS Flexbox Layout in order to implement alignment, sizing, and distribution of space.
(Thought/Question: should we define a coarse-grained and fine-grained API and create a table for methods available for both?)

## Usage
