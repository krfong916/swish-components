# Grid

Swish Grid is a responsive grid component that adapts to screen size and orientation.

## Design

Swish Grid uses CSS Flexbox Layout in order to implement alignment, sizing, and distribution of space. The Grid API is defined in the typescript declaration, `.d`, files.
(Thought/Question: should we define a coarse-grained and fine-grained API and create a table for methods available for both?)

## Usage

4 columns
8 columns
12 columns

Order is left up to the implementation, Grid does not support it out of the box
