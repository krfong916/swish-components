# Swish Design

## Contributing

Hi! I'm Kyle! Would you like to contribute to this design system? I'm looking for individuals of all experience levels to help build this Design System together! Swish is certainly in its baby stages, but I'm a firm-believer of its potential. There's lots to do and therefore, opportunities for high impact and experience. Your presence and efforts are welcome here. See issues for contributing.
