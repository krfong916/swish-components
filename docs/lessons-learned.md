lessons learned:
how is it that x happened?
we can change the systems and processes to better support people
we can only reduce an accident - harm reduction, lessen the percentage that failure will occur
we can only detect and repair problems quickly

lessons learned:

- test early, often - setup testing framework because it'll demonstrate how you'll use the component
- when developing
  - functionality first
  - accessibility second
  - styling third
- forget trying to be fanciful, write code that works and call it a day

- get started, get testing, get it up
- too much upfront planning hinders development
- this will help you have a process, have a plan
