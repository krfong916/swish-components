What problems does a design system solve?
The invention of a design system arose from

- user frustration that things don't work as they expect across applications, across environments
- inconsistent voice and branding for company as a result of engineers reinventing the design language wheel each project
- inefficient and static one-off artifacts that only live for the lifecycle of a specific project rather than available for an entire org

* We must center the needs of the people we serve in order to ideate an interface design.
* Should be created "ground-up" - with use cases and as use cases evolve.
* Must be a base system that teams can build on as they see fit, and - not a one-size-fits-all system. Therefore, a design system must be modular.
