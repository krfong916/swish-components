Design System Lifecycle

Accessibility should be a part of your process
Page performance

Developer adoption is a metric for the initial success of a design system.
These things need to happen

- documentation:
  - getting started / installing
  - migration guides
  - component usage guidelines
  - issue templates

Offer full flexibility over components to developers

- styling flexibility
  - borders
  - zebra stripes
  - background colors
- added functionality

  - filtering
  - sorting
  - batch actions

## what is

a style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap and backlog, serving an ecosystem

its designers engineers, marketing, the rest of the team sharing the responsibility to build a quality product
federated - designers from multiple product teams decide on the system together

bake accessibility in, instead of sprinkling it on top
clarity - eliminate ambiguity, enable people to understand and act with confidence
efficiency - streamline/optimize workflows
beauty - respect for people's time and attention through thoughtful elegant craftsmanship

v2mom
vision what you want to do
values what's most important about that vision
methods how you get the job done
obstacles what challenges, problems, and issues might stand in the way
measures how you know when you've suceeded

documentation is paramount
